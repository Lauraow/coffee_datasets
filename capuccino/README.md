## Description
A cappuccino (/ˌkæpʊˈtʃiːnoʊ/ (About this soundlisten); Italian pronunciation: [kapputˈtʃiːno]; Italian plural: cappuccini) is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).[1]

Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milks, and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.[2][3] It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.[4]

The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink.
